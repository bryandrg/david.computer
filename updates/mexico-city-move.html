                    <h5>I've Moved to Mexico City!</h5>
                    <time datetime="2025-06-02">JUN 02, 2025</time>
                </div>
               
                <p>Today marks one week since I signed the lease for my new place in Mexico City, and 
                    tomorrow marks two weeks since the day I arrived. This move is the culmination of 
                    months of preparation, and I am very happy with the way things have turned out. 
                    All the downsizing, researching, and planning definitely made things a lot easier; 
                    however, none of that would have mattered without the help of my friends and family. 
                    To them, I want to say thank you. You own a piece of my heart.</p>

                <h6>First Impressions of the City</h6>
                <p>One of the first things that caught my attention is how *huge* this city is. I knew 
                    it was the largest city in North America, but during my arrival flight, looking out 
                    the plane window, all I could see were buildings as far as the eye could see. I am 
                    very excited to call this place home and explore it during my free time.</p>

                </div>

                <h6>The Good</h6>
                <p>After living here for almost two weeks, I can safely say that one of my favorite 
                    things is how walkable the city is. Within a 10-minute walk I have convenience 
                    stores, markets with fruit, meat, cheese, etc., taco shops, a coffee shop, and 
                    many other small businesses. There's also a Metrobus station nearby, so if I 
                    want to go somewhere farther away, I can use public transportation. It is 
                    affordable and super fast. The most I've had to wait for a Metrobus was 8 minutes, 
                    and even that was rare. The metro comes every two or three minutes. Some of you 
                    might read this and think there's nothing special about walking around and using 
                    public transportation, but after living in a car-dependent society for ~8 years, 
                    I've learned not to take it for granted.</p>

                <p>I also love the number of cultural events and things to do on any given day. During 
                    my first week I visited the Cineteca Nacional (National Film Archive and Screening Center), 
                    the Museo Archivo de la Fotografía (Museum of the Photographic Archive), the Biblioteca 
                    Vasconcelos (Vasconcelos Library), and a handful of other landmarks such as Bellas Artes, 
                    the Metropolitan Cathedral, and the Angel of Independence. The Cineteca was definitely my 
                    favorite; it's enormous and they show exactly the kind of independent and international 
                    films I love. At the photography museum, they were exhibiting work by a photographer 
                    from Oaxaca, my home state, which felt like pure serendipity. I am excited to keep 
                    exploring the city during the upcoming months, which leads to my next point.</p>

                <p>And I have to mention the food! Growing up in Oaxaca, I was spoiled by incredible cuisine, 
                    and moving to the US meant missing those authentic flavors terribly. Even simple things 
                    like tortillas tasted different: oddly sweet, as if they had sugar in them. But coming back, 
                    all the smells and tastes immediately transported me back to my childhood. Getting tacos 
                    al pastor for the first time here was like that scene in Ratatouille, pure nostalgia and joy. 
                    I'm so happy to once again be surrounded by both rich cultural offerings and delicious food, 
                    just like when I was growing up.</p>

                <h6>The Bad</h6>
                <p>The only reason I haven't explored as much as I would like is that it has rained every afternoon 
                    without fail this entire week. It is raining as I type this. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the 
                    rain, but now that I live alone, I have to take great care of my health, which means staying 
                    indoors and not getting wet. Coming from the desert where it rains maybe twice a year, I was 
                    getting used to sunny days again, though ironically I was staying indoors anyway in Las Cruces 
                    due to all the wind and dust storms in recent months. In a funny way, the rain has actually 
                    helped me be more responsible; when I get the urge to go out and explore, I remember I also need 
                    to study, clean, and cook for myself, so these rainy afternoons have become productive time for 
                    job prep and settling into my new routine.</p>

                <h6>The Ugly</h6>
                <p>It is important to also recognize that I am speaking (or writing) from a position of privilege. 
                    I am aware that not everyone has the same opportunities I have had. Not everyone can study abroad 
                    and then return to their home country; not everyone can afford to move out on their own to a big 
                    city, let alone in a different country. I am also aware that the rain these past few days has caused 
                    floods and accidents in the city. The subway system is oversaturated during peak hours, and many 
                    people have to commute for hours just to make it to their jobs. With this in mind, I want to end 
                    this entry by expressing gratitude for this opportunity, for everything that has happened to me 
                    and that shaped me to make me who I am now and to bring me here. I hope one day I am able to give 
                    back to my community, even just a bit, so more people can receive opportunities, feel freer, and 
                    do as their heart pleases.</p>
