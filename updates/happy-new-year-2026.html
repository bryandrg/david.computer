                    <time datetime="2026-01-05">JAN 05, 2026</time>
                </div>
                
                <p>If you're reading this, it means the site is still standing after five months of 
                    neglect. The cobwebs have been swept, the footer has been updated, and I am back. 
                    Let me wish you a happy new year; may 2026 bring you warmth and solid ground.</p>
                
                <p>I should address the silence: I haven't posted since August. The short explanation 
                    is that I was deep in the job-hunting process for most of the second half of 2025, 
                    and I wanted to maintain confidentiality throughout. I didn't want to accidentally 
                    say something that could hurt my chances, so I chose silence. Now that everything 
                    is behind me (and I'm happy to share that the process was successful), I can resume 
                    regular updates. The monthly entries I missed will be posted eventually; I'm hoping 
                    to catch up this month, but I can't promise anything.</p>

                <h6>Seeds Planted in 2025</h6>
                <p>Last year, I wrote that 2025 would be about <em>finding my place</em>: my place in 
                    the world, online, professionally. Looking back, I can say with some disbelief 
                    that I did exactly that. I started a new life in a new city, navigated the job 
                    market, and somehow everything went according to plan.</p>
                
                <p>I want to be careful here because I know how this can sound. It didn't happen 
                    overnight, and it certainly didn't happen alone. This was the culmination of 
                    years of effort: my college years to get the degree, hours of research to build 
                    a plan, months of preparation for interviews. It felt like a boss fight where you 
                    finally have to use all the items and moves you've collected throughout the game.</p>
                
                <p>And even then, none of it would have been possible without the people who helped 
                    me along the way: friends, family, and even strangers who offered guidance when I 
                    needed it most. <em>Lo poco que soy, lo nada que he logrado, se lo debo a todos 
                    los que han contribuido a mi vida.</em> I think it's too soon to fully grasp how 
                    significant 2025 was. It truly was one of those years where everything changed.</p>

                <h6>What I Hope to Grow in 2026</h6>
                <p>If 2025 was about finding my place, 2026 will be about growing roots.</p>
                
                <p>It's been so long since I've felt like I could actually <em>settle</em>; build 
                    something with the confidence that the ground beneath me won't shift. Now that 
                    I'm in the city I want, with the job I want, I feel like I can finally 
                    start building my own little life with more certainty than before.</p>
                
                <p>This year I want to do more "adult" things: start saving properly, build my 
                    credit, move into a bigger place: maybe a whole apartment instead of just a 
                    small room. I might even think about getting a car eventually, though for now 
                    I'm very happy using public transportation. Small steps, one at a time.</p>
                
                <p>More than anything, though, I want to cultivate presence. Attention. Patience. 
                    Time. These feel like the quiet foundations that make everything else possible, the 
                    kind of grounding that lets you actually <em>be</em> somewhere instead of just 
                    passing through. I wish the same for you, whoever is reading this.</p>
                
                <p>There's an African proverb that says: <em>"When the roots are deep, there is no 
                    reason to fear the wind."</em> After years of feeling like a leaf in the wind, 
                    I'm ready to see what it feels like to finally have roots.</p>
                
                <p>Here's to 2026. May it be the best year of our lives.</p>
