                    <h5>Monthly Notes: February 2025</h5>
                </div>
                <h6>Summary</h6>
                <p>During the month of February, I finished two books and saw six movies, four of 
                    them for the first time. I also saw one play.</p>

                <h6>Personal</h6>
                <p>Although it is the shortest month of the year, this particular February felt like 
                    three lifetimes. It was a month of planning and prepping. I have realized that it's 
                    lightness, rather than weight, what I'm going after in this stage of my life.</p>

                <h6>Books</h6>
                <p>I finished <em>El invencible verano de Liliana</em>, which I thought was excellent 
                    and I thoroughly recommend. It's a sad book given the context under which it came 
                    to be but I see it as a rebellious act of love. Rarely do I come across a piece of 
                    work with so many beautiful references. It gave me an enormous desire to live, seek 
                    new feelings, see new things with my eyes, read more poetry, listen to old songs. 
                    It is true that every person is a universe, and this book is a window into Liliana's universe.</p>
                
                <p>I also read <em>The Fall</em> by Camus, which I also enjoyed but I didn't feel as 
                    alluring as <em>The Stranger</em>. I will probably come back to it in the future 
                    since it gave me a lot to think about but I didn't really connect with it.</p>
                
                <p>In <em>El invencible verano de Liliana</em>, the following poem is mentioned and included, 
                    which I genuinely found so touching and appropriate. I share it here:</p>
                
                <div class="poem-container">
                    <div class="poem">
                        <p>Todo lo que has perdido, me dijeron, es tuyo.<br>
                        Y ninguna memoria recordaba que es cierto.<br>
                        Todo lo que destruyes, afirmaron, te hiere.<br>
                        Traza una cicatriz que no lava el olvido.<br>
                        Todo lo que has amado, sentenciaron, ha muerto.<br>
                        No quedó ni la sombra, se acabó para siempre.<br>
                        Todo lo que creíste, repitieron, es falso.<br>
                        Se hundieron las palabras con que empezó tu tiempo.<br>
                        Todo lo que has perdido, concluyeron, es tuyo.<br>
                        Y una luz fugitiva anegará el silencio.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="poem-attribution">
                        — "Luz y silencio" del libro Los Elementos de la noche <br>
                        Jose Emilio Pacheco
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h6>Music</h6>
                <p>Also in <em>El invencible verano de Liliana</em>, the song Lucha de gigantes 
                    plays a significant role in the backdrop, and I remembered it is also part of 
                    the end credits Soundtrack in <em>Amores Perros</em> (2000), great movie. I am 
                    including a live performance of it here.</p>
                
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 460px;">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c5S6DFiQyWo?si=6ec2xpBLOrXg8a1v" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>

                <h6>Movies</h6>
                <p>Out of the four movies I watched for the first time in February, <em>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</em>, 
                    and <em>The Brutalist</em> stood out due to their soundtracks by Philip Glass and Daniel Bloomberg, 
                    respectively. The set design and cinematography in <em>Mishima</em> were really breathtaking, and I'd 
                    love to see it in the theater some day. It's one of those movies where some frames could easily be paintings.</p>

                <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2emAke19a5osu3yr1YbJV9?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
                
                <p>I also have to say, I found the first half of <em>The Brutalist</em> so excellent, it nearly 
                    brought me to tears a couple of times but by the time it ended I was not convinced it had to 
                    be so long and I was not totally satisfied with the way the story developed. Not going to 
                    spoil anything but I will just say that if it had ended shortly after the intermission, it 
                    would have been a 5/5 for me.</p>

                <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6HGPnSZRHXwERGEmZ4Wh6W?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

                <h6>Plays</h6>
                <p>I had the opportunity to see <em>The Vagina Monologues</em> put up by NMSU theater 
                    and it was really an experience to see the talented performers and their work. It's 
                    interesting how vulnerability takes strength; how the act of opening oneself up to 
                    potential judgment or harm requires a deeper courage than keeping everything safely 
                    hidden. The performers embodied this paradox beautifully. I definitely think you 
                    should see it if you have the chance. These topics should be shared especially in times like these.</p>

                <h6>Closing thoughts</h6>
                <p>I have been busy decluttering and downsizing all my possessions, hence the reason 
                    this monthly review goes up so late into the month. I have been working on arrangements 
                    and plans that I can't reveal now but that will make sense in the future. It's one of 
                    those stages in life where you're about to make a big step so you have to be brave and 
                    build courage to be prepared. My heart has been filled with hope.</p>
                
                <p>This pursuit of lightness in my life has me contemplating what it means to live lightly 
                    yet meaningfully. In that spirit, I'll close with these words from Huxley:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "It's dark because you are trying too hard. Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. Yes, feel lightly even though you're feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them. I was so preposterously serious in those days… Lightly, lightly – it's the best advice ever given me…So throw away your baggage and go forward. There are quicksands all about you, sucking at your feet, trying to suck you down into fear and self-pity and despair. That's why you must walk so lightly. Lightly my darling…"<br>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="quote-attribution">— Aldous Huxley, <em>Island</em>, 1962</p>
