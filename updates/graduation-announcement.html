                        <p>I'm thrilled to share that I've recently graduated from New Mexico State University 
                            with a B.S. in Computer Science! My academic journey has been quite the adventure. 
                            I started back in 2018 through the Aggie Pathway program, taking my initial 
                            courses at Doña Ana Community College before transferring to NMSU. Initially, I 
                            pursued Physics and was thriving in the Honors College with several scholarships 
                            under my belt.</p>

                        <p>Then came the pandemic around my junior year, and like many others, I found myself 
                            struggling with the transition to online learning. After some challenging 
                            experiences with advanced math courses and deep reflection about my future path, I 
                            realized that while Physics had been fascinating, my heart was pulling me in a 
                            different direction. Computer Science had always been on my radar, after all, I'd 
                            grown up around computers, and it was one of my top choices even before college.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In Spring 2022, I made the switch to Computer Science, and it felt right. While my journey 
                    took longer than the traditional four-year path, every step proved valuable. Those 
                    high-level Physics and Math courses, and even my later CS classes where I worked alongside 
                    graduate students, all contributed to a rich, interdisciplinary perspective that I wouldn't 
                    trade for anything.</p>

                <p>As I became more comfortable with my CS coursework, I was able to reconnect with my passion 
                    for art. While I was developing my skills in traditional mediums like charcoal drawing and 
                    photography, my HCI coursework opened my eyes to something fascinating: the principles of 
                    creating beauty could extend into software development. It was one of those wonderful 'aha' 
                    moments when you realize that creativity transcends mediums. Whether it's charcoal on 
                    paper or code on a screen, the fundamental appreciation for aesthetics and user experience 
                    remains the same. This parallel journey in traditional art flourished, leading to my work 
                    being displayed at <a href="/events/milagro-coffee-exhibition.html">Milagro Coffee Y Espresso</a> 
                    and culminating in my first solo exhibition at <a href="/events/hoja-al-viento.html">Cruces Creatives</a> 
                    in November 2024, a milestone I never would have imagined when I started college!</p>

                <p>This graduation represents more than just an academic achievement, it's a testament to 
                    finding your own path, even when it's not the most direct route. It's about discovering how 
                    different passions: technology, physics, and art, can weave together to create something 
                    unique. I'm excited to bring this multifaceted perspective to my future projects!</p>
