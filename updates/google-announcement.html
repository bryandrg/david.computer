                <p><strong>HERE WE GO!</strong></p>

                <p>I am very excited to announce that in December 2025 I started my first role 
                    post-college as a Software Engineer at Google México! It still feels surreal to 
                    type that out. After months of preparation, interviews, and waiting, we're finally here.</p>

                <p>I wanted to share an overview of my process for anyone who might find it useful, whether 
                    you're currently preparing for interviews, thinking about applying, or just curious 
                    about what the journey looks like. This is my story.</p>

                <h6>Good to Know</h6>
                <p>A few general notes about the process that might be helpful:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All my interviews were virtual (Google Meet). I didn't set foot inside the building 
                        until the day I signed the contract.</li>
                    <li>I used Python for all technical interviews.</li>
                    <li>The interview breakdown: 3 technical, 1 Googleyness, 3 team matching.</li>
                    <li>There can be a lot of waiting. Weeks of silence doesn't necessarily mean rejection.</li>
                    <li>I didn't do any internships during college, and I didn't practice LeetCode until after 
                        I graduated. All of my preparation started post-graduation. If you're in a similar 
                        situation, it's not too late.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- ==================== LIFE IS A MOVIE ==================== -->

                <h6>Life is a Movie</h6>
                <p>Some moments from this journey felt straight out of a film. I wanted to share them here.</p>

                <p><strong>The building visit.</strong> On August 23rd, I visited the Google Mexico City 
                    building. I just wanted to see it. I knew at some point I was going to work there, I 
                    just didn't know when. Standing outside, looking up at it, wondering what it would be 
                    like inside. 96 days later, I returned to that same building to sign my contract.</p>

                </div>

                <p><strong>The preparation.</strong> From June 18 to October 2, I practiced LeetCode every 
                    single day. Most days, my routine was: wake up at 5:50 AM, shower, have some coffee, 
                    and study nonstop until noon. My max streak was 107 days. I was unemployed at the time, 
                    so I recognize that not everyone can afford this kind of routine. But for those who are 
                    in a similar situation, maybe between jobs, or preparing for their first role, I hope 
                    this shows what's possible.</p>

                </div>

                <p><strong>The call.</strong> On November 3rd, my recruiter sent an email asking if I was 
                    available for a quick phone call. I was in the shower. I missed the call. She said 
                    she'd call me the next day, but I told her I was available tomorrow but also <em>now</em>. 
                    She called. And that's when she told me I had been selected. Possibly one of the 
                    happiest moments of my life. All that preparation; months of waiting, interviews, 
                    uncertainty, finally paid off. I was part of the less than 1% that receive an offer 
                    from Google.</p>

                <!-- ==================== TIPS ==================== -->

                <h6>Tips</h6>
                <p>Here are some things I learned along the way:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Tailor your resume for each application.</strong> Don't send the same resume 
                    everywhere. Highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant for the specific 
                    position you're applying to. This was a game-changer for me; my second application was 
                    successful largely because I took this advice.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Don't worry about the other candidates.</strong> You can't control how others 
                    perform. Focus on being the best version of yourself in the interview. That's all you can do.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Believe you will eventually succeed.</strong> This sounds cliché, but it matters. 
                    The process is long and uncertain. There will be moments when you think it's over. 
                    Rejections hurt, but remember: you only have to win once. There are countless opportunities 
                    out there, and eventually, one of them will be yours. Keep going.</p>

                <p><strong>4. During technical interviews: explain your thought process.</strong> Talk through 
                    your thinking with the interviewer. Don't just code in silence. They want to see how you 
                    approach problems, not just whether you can solve them.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Don't start coding right away.</strong> Take time to understand the problem. I 
                    used a small whiteboard to sketch out my approach before writing any code. This helped me 
                    organize my thoughts and communicate clearly with the interviewer.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Allow yourself time outside of preparation.</strong> Burnout is real. Take breaks. 
                    Do things you enjoy. The goal is to be sharp and present during your interviews, not 
                    exhausted from non-stop grinding.</p>

                <p><strong>7. Reach out if you haven't heard back.</strong> During the radio silence periods, 
                    I reached out to my recruiter just to confirm I was still in the process. It's okay to 
                    do this. A polite check-in is completely reasonable.</p>

                <!-- ==================== FINAL THOUGHTS ==================== -->

                <h6>Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p>This process took about six months from application to first day. It was longer than I 
                    expected, with more waiting and uncertainty than I was prepared for. But it was worth it.</p>

                <p>I'm incredibly grateful for this opportunity, it truly changed my life. To my recruiter for 
                    believing in me and selecting me among hundreds (maybe thousands) of applicants, to my 
                    cousin for his generosity and guidance, to my manager for the opportunity, and to 
                    everyone who supported me along the way.</p>

                <p>If you're reading this and you're in the middle of your own process: with discipline 
                    and consistency, things can change. Good luck.</p>

                <p>Here's to new beginnings. 🌱</p>
