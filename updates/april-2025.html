                <h6>Summary</h6>
                <p>During April, the first full month of spring, I turned one year older. I saw four movies, 
                    three of them for the first time. This month felt rather heavy; it marks the end of a cycle.</p>

                <h6>Personal</h6>
                <p>Like a flower blossoming in spring, I'm proud to announce that my frontal lobe is now fully 
                    developed. Even if this has been <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/comment/brain-myth-25-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debunked as a myth</a>, there's an undeniable weight in saying 
                    "I turned 25" or "I am now 25 years old." I have been on this earth for a quarter of a century. 
                    Even writing it down or saying it out loud requires a certain solemnity on my part. When I 
                    turned 10, 15, 18, and then 21 (all significant ages for seemingly different reasons) I expected
                    all the secrets of the universe to be revealed in front of me in a little parade. Things would 
                    finally make sense, I thought. As you might already know, this never happened.</p>

                <p>I expected 25 to be more of the same; I'd turn one year older like how the hands on a clock change 
                    position while the clock itself remains unchanged. The day before my birthday, Pope Francis passed 
                    away, and the day after, while sharing a moment with my mom and sister, I realized this might have 
                    been the last year we all get together for my birthday. Things have felt a bit heavy since then. 
                    If I had to put it into words, I'd say it feels as if I am mourning my childhood. If I had to compare 
                    it to a feeling, I would say it feels like falling. Even though I know the imaginary bottom is safe, 
                    the sensation is still there. If it were a sound, it would be this piece from the opening scene in The Brutalist.</p>

                <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6HGPnSZRHXwERGEmZ4Wh6W?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

                <p>Lastly, I want to mention that towards the end of March, I accidentally started a 30-day mindfulness challenge 
                    (I misread and thought it was a 30-minute challenge) which consisted in meditating every day for 30 days 
                    and I completed this challenge in the middle of April. I only missed one day, so I think I can say I completed it successfully.</p>

                <h6>Books</h6>
                <p>No books were completed during this month. One development is that the physical books I was 
                    reading now exist in the digital world, on my e-reader. I'm hoping this change can help me 
                    read more since it's easier to carry a phone-sized device rather than a paperback, at least in most cases.</p>

                <h6>Music</h6>
                <p>For April, I want to share this live version of "Watermelon In Easter Hay" performed by Frank Zappa in 1988.</p>

                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWBYjjzKvIw?si=aKdUSG78bV4zCAzN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>

                <h6>Movies</h6>
                <p>Two movies I saw in April that I would like to highlight are Sinners (2025) and Conclave (2024). It bugs me 
                    that both are recent releases because I feel like I can't really talk about them without spoiling them, but 
                    the production design and cinematography in Conclave are top-notch. For Sinners, I really enjoyed the story 
                    and characters.</p>

                <h6>Closing thoughts</h6>
                <p>Maybe it was turning 25, maybe it was the events surrounding my birthday, or maybe it's that I'm in a transition 
                    period, but April did feel heavier than previous months this year. This is a good time to remind myself to take 
                    things lightly even when they feel heavy. Here's hoping for lighter months ahead.</p>
