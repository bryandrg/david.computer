                    <h5>Hoja al Viento: My First Solo Exhibition</h5>
                </div>

                <p>Sometimes the best opportunities come from simply being in your favorite places. 
                    On August 24th, 2024, as I was about to leave Milagro Coffee Y Espresso, Lee from 
                    Cruces Creatives called out my name. He had seen my artwork during my Milagro 
                    exhibition and offered me something incredible: a chance to create my own solo 
                    show in November. Despite the timing (right in the middle of my final semester of 
                    college!), I couldn't say no to such an amazing opportunity.</p>

                <div class="content-with-image">
                    <img src="/images/events/hoja/milagro.webp" alt="Flyer at Milagro">
                </div>

                <h6>The Journey to Opening Night</h6>
                <p>Initially I had planned to show just photographs (thinking it would be 
                    simpler during a busy semester)  but this idea later evolved into something much more comprehensive. 
                    For the first time ever, I printed around 100 of my photographs in postcard size, 
                    images I'd captured around Las Cruces with my digicams and Fujifilm camera. I must say, there's 
                    something magical about holding a photograph in your hands instead of just seeing it on a screen.</p>

                <p>The final exhibition brought together multiple aspects of my artistic journey:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>18 charcoal drawings (some from my private collection, never before shown)</li>
                    <li>4 hand-carved eraser prints (a new technique I'd been exploring)</li>
                    <li>Around 50 mounted photographs (with more available to browse on opening night)</li>
                    <li>Pieces ranging from an intimate 4x6-inch graphite drawing of a school chair that 
                    caught my eye during class, to my largest piece: a 27x40-inch charcoal drawing inspired 
                    by the 2018 Chilean film "La Casa Lobo"</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Creating an Atmosphere</h6>
                <p>For the first time, I had complete control over the installation process. Every piece was 
                    thoughtfully placed at eye-level, creating an intimate viewing experience. The music selection 
                    for opening night was something I pondered deeply. I was initially drawn to 
                    <a href = "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus'_Blood_Never_Failed_Me_Yet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet",</a> 
                    a fascinating piece with its own beautiful story. While I loved the idea of 
                    such a powerful ambient piece, I ultimately chose something more subtle: Minecraft's peaceful 
                    soundtrack, which created exactly the calm, inviting atmosphere I was hoping for.</p>

                <p>Adding to the welcoming environment were delicious refreshments from Foxtail Fern Bakery, 
                    including gluten-free and dairy-free options to ensure everyone could enjoy them. 
                    The chocolate chip cookies, horchata krispie treats, and mint chocolate cookies were a hit!</p>

                <h6>Opening Night</h6>
                <p>The reception exceeded expectations, drawing both familiar faces and new admirers. One 
                    particularly memorable comment came from a visitor who observed that he could "see the colors" 
                    in the black-and-white charcoal drawings and the "lights and shadows" in the color photographs. 
                    Another visitor was moved to tears by a photograph, a reaction I never expected my work could evoke.</p>

                <p>Since the beginning I knew I wanted visitors to be able to leave their mark or take something 
                    with them. I ended coming up with a drawn tree where visitors could add their own leaves using my 
                    hand-carved stamps and fall-colored ink pads. This tied into the exhibition's title "Hoja al Viento" 
                    (Leaf in the Wind), inspired by a line from "Canci√≥n Mixteca": "Y al verme tan solo y triste cual 
                    hoja al viento..." While the song speaks to missing home, the interactive tree became a symbol of 
                    finding community wherever we land. We're all leaves from the same tree.</p>

                    <img src="/images/events/hoja/tree.webp" alt="Interactive tree installation where visitors added leaves">
                </div>

                <p>As a special thank-you to visitors, everyone at the opening reception could take home a free print 
                    made from my hand-carved erasers, a small piece of the exhibition to keep.</p>

                <p>The event's success was measured not just in sales, but in the connections formed. Visitors signed 
                    up for future updates, contributed to the collaborative tree installation, and shared their 
                    appreciation for the carefully curated atmosphere. Even the exhibition's promotional materials 
                    carried a personal touch, featuring my hand-carved leaf prints and handwriting, later digitized 
                    for distribution.</p>

                <h6>Looking Back</h6>
                <p>Running from November 8th through November 28th, 2024, to me this exhibition was more than just 
                    displaying art, it was about creating an experience that people could connect with. When 
                    visitors told me the space felt beautiful and that they were glad they came, it meant everything 
                    to me. For the first time, I got to see a room filled entirely with my art, arranged exactly as I envisioned it.</p>

                <p>I'm incredibly grateful to Lee for offering me this opportunity, to Cruces Creatives for providing 
                    such a wonderful space, and to everyone who came to share in this experience with me. Whether you 
                    attended, shared the event, or just sent good vibes my way: thank you for being part of this journey.</p>
