                    <h5>My First Exhibition: A Dream at Milagro</h5>
                </div>

                <p>What began as a simple morning sketch blossomed into an unexpected opportunity for my 
                    first art exhibition. On March 11, 2024, while keeping up with my "draw every day" 
                    resolution at Milagro Coffee Y Espresso, I sketched the fresh flowers they set on 
                    their tables during the spring, a small moment that would lead to one of the most 
                    exciting experiences of my year.</p>

                <div class="content-with-image">
                    <img src="/images/events/milagro/sketch2.webp" alt="Morning sketch of fresh flowers at Milagro Coffee">
                </div>

                <p>After sharing the sketch on Instagram and tagging the coffee shop, I received a 
                    surprising message from Milagro's account asking if I'd be interested in displaying 
                    my artwork in their space. As someone who had spent countless hours enjoying their 
                    cappuccinos, pastries, and good company, the thought of having my art grace the walls 
                    of this community gathering place felt like a dream come true.</p>

                <h6>The Exhibition</h6>
                <p>The exhibition ran from June 11th to July 29th, 2024, featuring seven pieces that 
                    showcased different aspects of my artistic journey. Rather than displaying numerous 
                    small pieces, I chose to focus on fewer but larger pieces, mindful of how visitors 
                    would view them from a distance. The collection included four large portraits, two 
                    smaller intimate pieces, and a special portrait of my cat, Perlita, marking her 
                    debut in the public eye.</p>

                <p>The portrait selection was carefully curated to represent diverse subjects and 
                    narratives. My choices included historical figures, contemporary subjects, and my 
                    first large-scale charcoal drawing: a rendition of Michelangelo's David, a piece 
                    with personal significance as we share the same name. Each piece was chosen to 
                    contribute to a broader conversation about representation in portraiture.</p>

                <h6>Behind the Scenes</h6>
                <p>Dropping off the artwork on June 10th was particularly memorable because I got to 
                    meet John, Milagro's owner. His passion for community and genuine love for what he 
                    does was immediately apparent. Getting a peek behind the scenes of my favorite coffee 
                    shop was exciting enough, but seeing the staff's reactions to my work in the following 
                    days was even better; their enthusiastic compliments meant the world to me.</p>

                <h6>The Experience</h6>
                <p>Seeing my artwork displayed in such a welcoming and familiar space was incredible. Even 
                    more thrilling was when several pieces found permanent homes with buyers who felt a 
                    connection to them. Each sale validated my artistic journey, but honestly, just having 
                    my work displayed in such a vibrant community hub was reward enough.</p>

                <h6>Personal Growth</h6>
                <p>This exhibition marked many firsts: my first public showing, my first art sales, and my 
                    first experience presenting my work in a professional setting. It taught me important 
                    lessons about curating, presentation, and considering how viewers engage with art in 
                    public spaces.</p>

                <p>Looking back, what started as a simple morning sketch transformed into a significant 
                    milestone in my artistic development. The opportunity to share my work with the Las 
                    Cruces community for the first time was both humbling and inspiring, setting the stage 
                    for future artistic endeavors.</p>

                <p>I'm deeply grateful to Milagro for this opportunity and to everyone who took the time 
                    to look at, comment on, or connect with my work. This exhibition marked the beginning 
                    of my journey as a displaying artist, and I couldn't have asked for a better starting point!</p>
