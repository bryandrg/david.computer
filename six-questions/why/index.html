                    <h5>Why</h5>
                </div>
                
                <h6>The World You Were Born in No Longer Exists</h6>
                <p>Growing up I was surrounded by computers. The Internet seemed like a place 
                    you could escape to. Flash games, Encarta, and a wide variety of fun websites. 
                    Fast forward to now, and the barrier between the internet as a space and the 
                    'outside' has never been more blurred. It used to be that you visited the 
                    internet but now we are online all the time, chronically, if you will. Most of 
                    us visit the same three or four websites almost every day. I remember I had to 
                    wait until I got home after school and opened Messenger on the home computer to see any 
                    messages I had received since the last time I logged in. Now we are expected 
                    to be reachable 24/7 since the majority of us have a computer in our pockets 
                    at all times. The boundary between the online and offline is now a piece of 
                    glass, physically and metaphorically.</p>
                
                <h6>Building a house in borrowed land</h6>
                <p>Over the past few years most of my internet activity happened on Instagram dot com. As 
                    much as I personalize my profile, ultimately, Instagram is not mine. It could 
                    cease to exist tomorrow, and with it, tons of images, messages, moments, would 
                    be gone forever. We already saw this recently when tons of archived stories 
                    stopped being available, seemingly forever. No explanation or reinstatement. 
                    This made me realize that I was building a house in borrowed land. This piece of land could
                    just disappear one day or they could also kick me out. Where am I going to 
                    'live'? I have no brand deals with Instagram, I am not earning money by posting 
                    there or by keeping your attention there. Many times, the interests of Instagram 
                    do not align with my goals. If you add to that the format limitations and the 
                    missing features (my main account still can't have more than 10 photos in a carousel 
                    post), it is clear that it's time to start looking for a new place to 'live' online.</p>
                
                <h6>The internet is dead, long live the internet</h6>
                <p>I am sure you've heard in the last year or so, of people talking about 'brain rot', 
                    'doomscrolling', 'being chronically online'. These terms are all a result of the 
                    effects of companies spending millions of dollars to get as much of your attention 
                    as they possibly can. I'm sure you've also heard that "if something is free, you are the product". Short term content, 
                    quirky gimmicks, algorithms taking advantage of fear-mongering to show you outrageous 
                    posts so you stay, even if it's just a tiny bit longer, on their platform. All so they can 
                    serve you another ad. It doesn't have to be this way. We can connect meaningfully and 
                    consume responsibly. There are no ads on this site, I don't track anything you do on 
                    here, there is no login or account information. You can come and go as you please. 
                    Updates are posted on the home page so if there's anything new, you'll see it there, 
                    otherwise you're free to go. No algorithm trying to grab your attention. It might not 
                    be perfect, but I believe it is a step in the right direction given the current moment.</p>
